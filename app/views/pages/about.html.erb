<div class ="jumbotron">
<p>I'm currently a third year student at the University of California Santa Cruz and this whole site is my attempt to learn some web design!<p>
<p>I'm currently hosting this site through heroku (if that isn't already obvious in the domain) with all images being hosted through Amazon S3 since heroku doesn't deal with that stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway here's a link to
<%= link_to "My Resume on Google Docs", "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wfe6yJcuZrGAj1vgRgJ8VRaIJy2MKjIWILTBXCWoSb0/edit?usp=sharing", data: { confirm: "This will leave the current site, are you sure you wish to continue?" }, class: "btn btn-primary" %> if you are interested.</p>
<p>Also, if you wanted to look through the code of the site itself here's the entire thing up on <%= link_to "Github", "https://github.com/Jbelles/My-Site", data: {confirm:"This will leave the current site, are you sure you wish to continue?" }, class: "btn btn-primary" %></p>
